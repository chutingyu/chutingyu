### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Chuting Yu.

I am a future PhD student at ielab in The University of Queensland, Australia, I work with A/Prof. Guido Zuccon. I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computing Science at the Ningbo Institute of Technology (NIT) in China in 2020. After Bachelorâ€™s degree, I went to the University of Queensland for a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering, which was completed at the end of 2021 and awarded Masterâ€™s degree .

I am working at the intersection of Systematic Review, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) applications, where I utilises different approaches to empower the systematic review literature search. My recent work seeks to address the gap between boolean queries, deep language models, and task-oriented search through different approaches that helps to improve the search query effectiveness with minimal efficiency cost.
